Pyalpm documentation
=====================

Pyalpm is a Python package that provides you native bindings to both libalpm
and pacman. If you need to interact with alpm databases or programatically call
pacman in a safe, sensible way, you're in the right place.


Package structure
-----------------

Pyalpm exposes two Python modules: alpm (Python bindings libalpm) and pycman (a
Python module exposing pacman functionalities).
